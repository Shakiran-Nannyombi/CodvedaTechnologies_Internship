Welcome to my repository for the Data Analytics Internship at **Codveda Technologies**! This repository documents my journey, tasks, and learnings throughout this one-month program.

## About the Internship

This internship is a one-month intensive program focused on practical data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. The primary goal is to work with diverse datasets to extract meaningful insights, build predictive models, and present the findings.

### Key Objectives

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building and Evaluating Machine Learning Models
- Data Visualization and Storytelling
- Version Control with Git and GitHub

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to keep the tasks and datasets structured and easy to navigate.

- `level1/`, `level2/`, `level3/`: These directories will hold the levels of tasks from **Basic** to **Advanced**. Then notebooks and reports for each task for each level will be stored as I complete them.

## Technologies & Tools

I'll be using a variety of tools and libraries to tackle the tasks in this internship.

## Tasks & Deliverables

Here is a simple summary of the tasks I will be working on during the internship.

| Task | Dataset | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Iris Flower Classification** | `iris.csv` | Classify iris flowers into three species based on measurements. |
| **2. Stock Price Analysis** | `Stock Prices Data Set.csv` | Analyze and potentially predict stock price movements. |
| **3. Sentiment Analysis** | `Sentiment dataset.csv` | Determine the sentiment from a given text dataset. |
| **4. House Price Prediction** | `house Prediction Data Set.csv` | Predict house prices based on various features. |
| **5. Customer Churn Prediction** | `churn-bigml-80.csv` | Predict whether a customer will churn or not. |

## Results & Learnings

This section will be updated with the outcomes of each task, including key findings, model performance, and personal learnings. My goal is to not only complete the tasks but also to understand the "why" behind the data and the models.
